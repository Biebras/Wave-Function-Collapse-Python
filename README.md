# Wave Functio Collapse

The wave function collapse (WFC) algorithm is a computational technique used for generating complex patterns and textures from a set of input samples or tiles. It is based on quantum mechanics and involves the use of the superposition principle to determine the output. The WFC algorithm has been used in various applications such as game development, graphics design, and natural phenomenon simulation.
